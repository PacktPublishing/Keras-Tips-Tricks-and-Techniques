## About the Video Course
Machine learning and deep learning allow us to interpret data structures and fit that data into models to identify patterns and make predictions. Keras makes this easier with its huge set of libraries that can be easily used for machine learning.
In this course, you will upgrade your Keras skills with several more advanced applications. It is essential to keep upgrading your machine learning and deep learning skills as enormous advances take place every day. In this course, you will get hands-on experience in solving real problems by implementing cutting-edge techniques to significantly boost your Keras skills and, as a consequence, expand your ability to apply Keras to real-world problems. Throughout the course, you will work on real datasets to increase your expertise and keep adding new tools to your Keras toolbox.
By the end of this course, you will learn various tips, tricks, and techniques to upgrade your machine learning and deep learning algorithm knowledge as well as how to build efficient models with Keras.
By the end of this course, you will have learned various tips, tricks, and techniques to upgrade your machine learning and deep learning algorithm knowledge; you will also be able to build efficient models with Keras.
